# Decisions

One file per decision. Front matter carries `status`, `date`, `tags` and the
`hosts` it applies to.

Open items, shortest path first:
[0008](0008-nothing-tells-anyone-when-something-breaks.md) is a
script and two hooks, waiting on a Telegram bot;
[0005](0005-consolidate-to-proxmox.md) is a project, and paused. Closed on
2026-09-06: both router problems under
[0007](0007-router-config-is-not-ours-to-edit.md), and the missing third backup
copy under [0006](0006-a-third-copy-on-proxmox.md) — which covers losing the
machine, not losing the building. The graphs added under
[0011](0011-host-metrics-run-natively.md) show load, not breakage: they are
read when someone opens the dashboard, so they do not close
[0008](0008-nothing-tells-anyone-when-something-breaks.md).
